# Cheli
Chess API in C++

This is a rewrite from the unfinished c version (https://github.com/MarvinKatapult/chess-cli)

# How to build
Current build support is only for linux/unix

## Linux
Dependencies:

- g++
Just start the build.sh script. 

If you want to build the static library pass the -lib flag
For the shared object pass the -so flag

# The Idea
Chess-cli is supposed to be a all around chess playing experience straight in the terminal. Currently the following features are to be implemented:

- Playing chess with notation on the side
- Api to get available moves for position
- Support for Fenstring
